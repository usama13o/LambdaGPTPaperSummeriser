6. Summary:
- (1): The research background of this article is image restoration under adverse weather conditions, which is of significant interest for various computer vision applications.
- (2): Past methods for image restoration under adverse weather conditions have mainly relied on DNNs and generative adversarial networks (GANs), but they have limitations in multi-task vision restoration and size-agnostic processing. The approach in this paper is well-motivated by the recent progress achieved with state-of-the-art conditional generative models.
- (3): The research methodology proposed in this paper is a patch-based diffusive image restoration algorithm based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models. It enables size-agnostic image restoration by using a guided denoising process with smoothed noise estimates across overlapping patches during inference.
- (4): The methods in this paper are evaluated on benchmark datasets for image desnowing, combined deraining and dehazing, and raindrop removal. They achieve state-of-the-art performances on weather-specific and multi-weather image restoration tasks. The performance supports their goals of improving vision in adverse weather conditions.





8. Conclusion:

- (1): The significance of this piece of work lies in its contribution to image restoration under adverse weather conditions. The authors address the limitations of previous methods by proposing a patch-based diffusive image restoration algorithm based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models. This algorithm enables size-agnostic image restoration and achieves state-of-the-art performances on various weather-specific and multi-weather image restoration tasks.

- (2): The strengths of this article can be summarized in three dimensions:

  - Innovation point: The use of guided denoising with smoothed noise estimates across overlapping patches during inference is a novel approach that overcomes the size limitation of previous methods. This innovation allows for multi-task vision restoration and improves the overall quality of restored images.

  - Performance: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets for image desnowing, combined deraining and dehazing, and raindrop removal. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in restoring vision under different adverse weather conditions.

  - Workload: The workload of implementing the proposed method is not explicitly mentioned in the article. However, the authors provide insights into the benefits and limitations of their approach, which can guide future research and development in the field of image restoration under adverse weather conditions.

The article brings innovation in the form of a patch-based diffusive image restoration algorithm and achieves notable performance improvements in restoring vision under adverse weather conditions. The workload aspect could have been further elaborated on, but overall, this work showcases a significant contribution to the field of computer vision.
