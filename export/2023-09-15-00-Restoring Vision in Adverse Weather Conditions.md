6. Summary:
- (1): The research background of this article is image restoration under adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rain or snow, which is a challenging problem in computer vision.
- (2): Past methods for image restoration in adverse weather conditions mainly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative modeling methods. However, these methods have limitations in size-agnostic image restoration and handling multiple weather corruptions. The approach in this paper is well motivated by the recent progress in deep learning and generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models.
- (3): The research methodology proposed in this paper is a patch-based image restoration algorithm based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The approach utilizes a guided denoising process with smoothed noise estimates to restore images of arbitrary sizes. It extends the practicality of state-of-the-art diffusion models by introducing a light-weight diffusion modeling approach.
- (4): The methods in this paper achieve state-of-the-art performance on various weather-specific and multi-weather image restoration tasks, including desnowing, combined deraining and dehazing, and raindrop removal. The performance demonstrates strong generalization to real-world test images, supporting the goals of improving vision in adverse weather conditions.
